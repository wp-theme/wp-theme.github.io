We're very grateful for how far Dart Frog has come while under the
[VeryGoodOpenSource](https://github.com/verygoodopensource) organization and
incredibly thankful to [Very Good Ventures](https://verygood.ventures) for
[investing in Dart Frog](https://verygood.ventures/blog/dart-frog-has-found-a-new-pond)
and taking it from idea to reality.

After many discussions with Very Good Ventures, Dart Frog maintainers, and the
community at large, **Dart Frog has moved to a
[new GitHub organization](https://github.com/dart-frog-dev)**! We feel confident
that this move will empower the community to take Dart Frog to the next level.

As Dart Frog moves to an independent organization, we're opening the doors for a
broader range of developers to get involved and help shape the project's
direction. Rest assured that the
[`dart_frog` ecosystem](https://pub.dev/publishers/dart-frog.dev/packages) isn't
going anywhere -- teams can confidently continue building their backends without
any interruptions or migrations.

## About the organization

The organization will consist of the same group of core maintainers who have
worked on Dart Frog since its inception in April 2022:
[**Alejandro Santiago**](https://github.com/alestiago),
[**Erick Zanardo**](https://github.com/erickzanardo),
[**Felix Angelov**](https://github.com/felangel),
[**Jochum van der Ploeg**](https://github.com/wolfenrain),
[**Marcos Sevilla**](https://github.com/marcossevilla), and
[**Renan Araujo**](https://github.com/renancaraujo).

This group may change over time based on contributions, availability, and other
factors. We plan to take inspiration from other successful open source
organizations like [Flame](https://flame-engine.org) that provide a nice
blueprint to follow.

## What's the impact?

The good news is we've worked really hard to make sure nothing changes for you
as a developer! You can continue to use the same
[`dart_frog`](https://pub.dev/packages/dart_frog) package and ecosystem. We aim
to release more frequently so stay tuned for new features, bug fixes, and more.

## What's next?

Speaking of what's next, here's a high level overview of what we have planned
for the rest of the year. We (the core maintainers) will be meeting in the near
future to do a more in-depth planning session and will update the public roadmap
as part of that meeting. Some of the work we have planned includes:

- **Maintenance**
  - Publish a new release to distribute all existing bug fixes
  - Automate releasing to pub.dev and the VSCode marketplace
  - Triage and burn down the existing backlog of issues
  - Review and burn down open pull requests
- **Features**
  - Add support for Dart workspaces
  - Add Dart API client generation
  - Add Dart API documentation generation
  - Prioritize and begin work on new features identified during our planning
- **Ecosystem**
  - Formally meet for the first time and do a planning session
  - Invest in growing and moderating the
    [new Dart Frog Discord Server](https://discord.gg/dart-frog)
  - Establish a larger social presence & plan events for the community

  releases, documentation improvements, community events, and more!

We're more excited than ever for the future of Dart Frog üéØ üê∏
